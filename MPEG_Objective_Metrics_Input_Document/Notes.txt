-For frame_0000.ply, removed all property names from the header file before
using it, except for x, y, z, R, G, B. The removed properties were not 
actually present in the PLY file anyway; just their names were.

-For frame_0000.ply, the x axis is different to what it is for the 8i point
clouds: x is vertical along her body, not horizontal, so the x shifts are 
in the vertical direction.

-Can't plot Y PSNR of input point cloud against itself (i.e., against shift
of 0), because the PSNR in this case is infinite.
